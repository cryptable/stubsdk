# Stubbing SDK
## Introduction
This SDK helps to write stubbing classes or functions to stub third party libraries. All classes and functions have a 
behaviour in the form of state transitions caused by input. Some functions or classes will perform output to be 
returned. This stubbing SDK helps to keep statistics of the calls, spies on the parameters delivered to the stubbed 
classes/functions. It also allows to add minimal stubbed functionalities and/or expectations to the functions.
